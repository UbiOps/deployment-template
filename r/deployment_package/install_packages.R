# This file can contain package installation instructions for your deployment, and will run
#  during the building phase of your deployment by using `Rscript install_packages.R`.

# Packages 'tidyverse', 'here', 'remotes' and 'renv' are already preinstalled.
# Using renv? You DON'T need to add the 'renv::restore()' instruction here. If an 'renv.lock' file is present in your
#  deployment package, it will automatically be restored. Please, have a look at 'renv.lock-template'.

# Example installation instruction:
# install.packages("randomForest")
